# Basic Calculator Program by Ashley

## Description
This is a simple **command-line calculator** program written in Python. It performs **basic arithmetic operations**, including:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Remainder (Modulus)

The program provides a **menu-driven interface**, allowing the user to select operations and enter two numbers for calculation.

## Features
✅ Handles invalid inputs gracefully (prompts user to enter valid numbers).  
✅ Protects against **division by zero**.  
✅ Repeatedly displays the menu until the user chooses to exit.  
✅ Provides clear and user-friendly output.

## How to Run
1. Save the Python code into a file called `calculator.py` (or any filename you prefer).
2. Run the program using Python:

   ```
   python calculator.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select operations and enter numbers.
